# Computer Architecture
Computer Architecture and Design

Consists of projects done during school year from the beginning to the end.

Projects are done using Digilent Inc's Nexys4 DDR board and Xilinx's Vivado 17.2.

Constraint, Simulation, and Sources files are created in Verilog on Vivado and are programmed into the Nexy4 DDR board.

Constraint files are used to detail the connections of the Nexys4 DDR to the Source file variables.

Simulation files are used to detail the test conditions using Vivado.
